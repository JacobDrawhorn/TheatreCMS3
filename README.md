# TheatreCMS3
# introduction
TheatreCMS3 is the interactive website for managing the content and productions for a theater/ acting company. The project is meant to be a content management service, for users who want to easily manage what displays on their website, without needing too much technical knowledge. TheaterCMS3 is a Model View Controller web application using Code First migrations. For this project, my team worked on the Rental portion of the website, and I had the opportunity to work on the Rental History section of the rental area. Throughout this process, I worked on my problem solving skills, breaking down large tasks into smaller tasks to be completed one at a time.
